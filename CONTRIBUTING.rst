Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

All bug reports, enhancements and feature requests are tracked in Jira.
Though not mandatory, we encourage you to first check for a bug report
among `Jira issues <https://jira.percona.com/projects/PSMDB/issues>`_
and in the `PR
list <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb/pulls>`_:
perhaps the bug has already been addressed.

For feature requests and enhancements, we ask you to create a Jira
issue, describe your idea and discuss the design with us. This way we
align your ideas with our vision for the product development.

If the bug hasn’t been reported / addressed, or we’ve agreed on the
enhancement implementation with you, do the following:

1. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_ this repository

2. Clone this repository on your machine and sync it with upstream.

   There are several active versions of the project. Each version has
   its dedicated branch:

   -  v6.0
   -  v7.0
   -  v8.0
   -  master - this branch is the source for the next version, should it
      appear. You should not commit your changes to master branch.

3. Create a branch for your changes based on the corresponding version
   branch. Please add the version to the end of the branch’s name
   (e.g. ``<new-branch-v8.0>``)

4. Make your changes. Please follow these `code
   guidelines <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/wiki/Server-Code-Style>`_
   to improve code readability.

5. Test your changes locally. See the `Running tests
   locally <#running-tests-locally>`_ section for more information

6. Commit the changes. Add the Jira issue number at the beginning of
   your message subject so that is reads as
   ``<JIRAISSUE> - My subject``. The `commit message
   guidelines <https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53>`_
   will help you with writing great commit messages

7. Open a pull request to Percona

8. Our team will review your code and if everything is correct, will
   merge it. Otherwise, we will contact you for additional information
   or with the request to make changes.

.. _build:

Building Percona Server for MongoDB
-----------------------------------

Instead of building Percona Server for MongoDB from source, you can
`download <https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-5.0/>`_
and use binary tarballs. Follow the `installation
instructions <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/5.0/install/tarball.html>`_ in our documentation.

To build Percona Server for MongoDB, you will need: 

- A modern C++ compiler capable of compiling C++20. You may use GCC 11.3 or newer 
- Amazon AWS Software Development Kit for C++ library 
- Python 3.10.x and Pip modules. 
- Poetry 1.5.1.
- The set of dependencies for your operating system.
- About 13 GB of disk space for the core binaries (`mongod`, `mongos`, and `mongo`) and about 600 GB for the `install-all` target.

The following table lists dependencies for Ubuntu 22.04 and Red Hat Enterprise 9 and compatible derivatives:

Build steps
~~~~~~~~~~~

Install operating system dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Debian/Ubuntu

  The following command installs the dependencies for Ubuntu 22.04:

  .. code:: bash

     $ sudo apt install -y gcc g++ cmake curl libssl-dev libldap2-dev libkrb5-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsasl2-dev liblz4-dev libbz2-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libzlcore-dev liblzma-dev e2fslibs-dev


* RHEL and derivatives

  The following command installs the dependencies for RHEL 9:

  .. code:: bash

     $ sudo yum -y install gcc gcc-c++ cmake curl openssl-devel openldap-devel krb5-devel libcurl-devel cyrus-sasl-devel bzip2-devel zlib-devel lz4-devel xz-devel e2fsprogs-devel
   

Build AWS Software Development Kit for C++ library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Clone the AWS Software Development Kit for C++ repository

   .. code:: bash

      $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp.git

2. Create a directory to store the AWS library

   .. code:: bash

      $ mkdir -p /tmp/lib/aws

3. Declare an environment variable ``AWS_LIBS`` for this directory
   
   .. code:: bash

      $ export AWS_LIBS=/tmp/lib/aws

4. Percona Server for MongoDB is built with AWS SDK CPP 1.9.379 version.
   Switch to this version

   .. code:: bash

      $ cd aws-sdk-cpp && git checkout 1.9.379

5. It is recommended to keep build files outside the SDK directory.
   Create a build directory and navigate to it

   .. code:: bash

      $ mkdir build && cd build

6. Generate build files using ``cmake``

   .. code:: bash

      $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release '-DBUILD_ONLY=s3;transfer' -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DMINIMIZE_SIZE=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${AWS_LIBS}"

7. Install the SDK

   .. code:: bash

      $ make install

Clone Percona Server for MongoDB repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Exit the AWS SDK build directory. You should end up in the directory
   where you started the build process.

   .. code:: sh

      $ cd ../..


2. Clone Percona Server for MongoDB repository

   .. code:: sh

      $ git clone https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb.git

3. Switch to the Percona Server for MongoDB branch that you are building
   
   .. code:: sh

      $ cd percona-server-mongodb && git checkout v8.0

4. Define Percona Server for MongoDB version (8.0.1 for the time of
   writing this document)

   .. code:: sh

      $ echo '{"version": "8.0.1"}' > version.json

Install Python and Python modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Make sure the ``python3``, ``python3-dev``, ``python3-pip``, ``python3-venv`` Python packages are installed on your machine. Otherwise, install them using the package manager of your operating system.

2. Create and activate the virtual environment for Poetry - a Python dependency management and packaging tool for Percona Server for MongoDB. It is a good practice to isolate Poetry from the rest of your system in a virtual environment to ensure that its dependencies are not accidentally upgraded nor uninstalled. Run the following commands and specify the path to your virtual environment in a `<venv_path>`. The ``--prompt`` flag helps you visually distinguish your virtual environment from the base Python installation.

   .. code:: sh   

      $ python3 -m venv <venv_path> --prompt mongo
      $ source <venv_path>/bin/activate 

3. Install Poetry:

   .. code:: sh

      (mongo) $ python3 -m pip install 'poetry==1.5.1'

4. Check that you are in the ``percona-server-mongodb`` directory and in the ``8.0`` Git branch and install Python dependencies with Poetry:

   .. code:: sh

      (mongo) $ python3 -m poetry install --no-root --sync

Build Percona Server for MongoDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build Percona Server for MongoDB, you must be in the ``percona-server-mongodb`` directory. 

Percona Server for MongoDB is available in two builds: 

- Pro builds. These builds include all functionalities plus features that are typically demanded by large enterprises. You can check what features are included in Pro builds in the `documentation <https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/8.0/psmdb-pro.html#features>`_. 
- Basic builds include all functionalities except the features included in Pro builds.
  
You can build either of the builds. Add the ``--full-featured`` flag for Pro builds or omit it for Basic builds. 

Run one of the following commands to build Percona Server for MongoDB from ``buildscripts/scons.py``

* Basic build

  .. code:: bash

     (mongo) $ buildscripts/scons.py --disable-warnings-as-errors --release --ssl --opt=on -j$(nproc --all) --use-sasl-client --wiredtiger --audit --inmemory --hotbackup CPPPATH="${AWS_LIBS}/include" LIBPATH="${AWS_LIBS}/lib ${AWS_LIBS}/lib64" install-mongod install-mongos
        

* Pro build

  .. code:: bash

     (mongo) $ buildscripts/scons.py --disable-warnings-as-errors --release --ssl --opt=on -j$(nproc --all) --use-sasl-client --wiredtiger --audit --inmemory --hotbackup --full-featured CPPPATH="${AWS_LIBS}/include" LIBPATH="${AWS_LIBS}/lib ${AWS_LIBS}/lib64" install-mongod install-mongos
        

This command builds core components of the database. Other available
targets for the ``scons`` command are:

-  ``install-mongod``
-  ``install-mongos``
-  ``install-servers`` (includes mongod and mongos)
-  ``install-core`` (includes mongod and mongos)
-  ``install-devcore`` (includes mongod, mongos, and jstestshell
   (formerly mongo shell))
-  ``install-all``

The built binaries are in the ``percona-server-mongodb`` directory.


.. _tests:

Running tests locally
---------------------

When you work, you should periodically run tests to check that your
changes don’t break existing code.

You can run tests on your local machine with whatever operating system
you have. After you submit the pull request, we will check your patch on
multiple operating systems.

Since testing Percona Server for MongoDB doesn’t differ from testing
MongoDB Community Edition, use `these guidelines for running
tests <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/wiki/Test-The-Mongodb-Server>`_

After your pull request is merged
---------------------------------

Once your pull request is merged, you are an official Percona Community
